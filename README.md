# Messenger

## Why?

Desire to practice a bit in iOS dev.

## Idea

Simple client, for interacting with [my Dummy API](https://github.com/SchrodZzz/DummyMessengerAPI). Using it you can easily create new account or authorize to existing one, if you have authorized before (within 6 hours) you can use application without entering the password. User can interact with his/her friends (sending and receiving messages) and create new ones. If you haven't chatted with your friend using this API, you can esealy send you first message to him/her by clicking your friend in your friends list.

## About Current Version

It's a __very raw__ version, which requires a lot of work to do (refactoring, bug fixing etc)
